# the summer also is good weather

* The whole rainy season is both wet and sticky. The gloomy sky appears hot and hot yellow light, making people be dazzling. The sun is suffocated in thick clouds and struggle to take a breath. Suddenly, one day, sound of "peng", the sky split, the sun passes through the dark clouds. The summer, come on.
* Just only a little rest assured. A breathe was suffocated in my heart for a long time and didn't catch up to call out, it was already burning into a hot wave. People like a clump of ferment flour that are baked into a round and drum bread. Gushing sweat bead is water vapor from this dough.
* A moment like this is special life. Your thinking, your desires and your life are all break away from the track of the past. The past had many necessary things which have become unnecessary. A moment like this, because  stay away from people's world, you will feel incomprehensible taste in hurry.
* A moment like this, there will be a little girl that raises her eyebrows and sings in children's voice: I like summer because of I can put on floral skirt.
* A moment like this, there will be a little boy that raises his head and says like an old man: I don't like to prepare, and jump into cool and refreshing pool with a thud.
* Grown up person can have a excuse which has let go of work. They can find a quiet place, raise bamboo chair, half lying and half down, both eyes open slightly, calmly look the world, calmly look yourself.
* Recall fighting at close quarters with weapons in the past, a self-mockery which why is it bitter on the lips. This is my heart, and it will also bring a touch of coolness and consolation to my life.
* Or take it out a book which has been read dozens of times, read gently, looked leisurely, accidentally found a well-written article in front of your eyes. That already familiar word often produce a wonderful melody in hot summer.
* Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, the melody of four seasons is different, but Summer is like that a string of notes, like that a paradise. It can make you get a quiet of mind in hot summer.
