# summer noon

* The Summer noon, most people like all sleeping at noon, but I wake up more time. Therefor, I can enjoy more about loneliness and abundance at that time.
* Since childhood, I have been stay away from sleeping at noon.
* At that time, in the countryside of the north. Our courtyard is very deep, and it turns out to be quiet.Therefor sleeping more quiet at noon.
* The mother always forced me to sleep at noon. But I usually got up quietly when my mother had been asleep. I gently crossed the one foot high threshold, went through the courtyard which has the lotus, opened the small door to go through the back flowers courtyard, to enjoy my own noon.
