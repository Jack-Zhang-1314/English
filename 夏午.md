# summer noon

* The Summer noon, most people like all sleeping at noon, but I wake up more time. Therefor, I can enjoy more about loneliness and fulfilled at that time.
* Since childhood, I have been stay away from sleeping at noon.
* At that time, in the countryside of the north. Our courtyard is very deep, and it turns out to be quiet.Therefor sleeping more quiet at noon.
* The mother always forced me to sleep at noon. But I usually got up quietly when my mother had been asleep. I gently crossed the one foot high threshold, went through the courtyard which has the lotus, opened the small door to go through the back flowers courtyard, to enjoy my own noon.
* The back flowers courtyard is very wonderful!
* Wild flowers of various colors, the red, the white, the pink, the blue, the purple, <span style="color:red">and also</span> the half pink and the half white, the half blue and the half red. Simply, you can not count how many colors! These flowers shake in slight wind and are shy like children.
* To the left of garden is vegetable garden which are planted with shallot which drilled out of the soil and eggplants which are blowed more and more fatter with invaild mouth. The cut pumpkins lie on the ground with the laugh, enjoy the quiet in the courtyard.
* To the right of garden is flowers house, which houses delicate and fragile from the south.
* Mother said: the flowers garden had fairy fox, children can't be allowed to enter. I always foot two or three steps, then stand the steps with the soil, mind what the fairy looks like.
* In the mind, the fairy fox was grandfather who loves to sleep at noon and keep long whiskers, wear pants which are the same as his whiskers' color.
* "Even if he came in, he is too lazy to interface with me." I mind
* And, he can live in flowers with together. I very envy her.
* The ground always has many ants. They are very industrious, and non-stop busy.
* In a rush, I see they can watch for a long time. Don't know why, they caught my attention. I don't like their small and thin look,but I admire their action which is composure, swift and regularity. Sometimes, I was worried that they will lost their road. I used a blad of grass to go it back when I saw a ant went too far. I don't know whether I distubre their work, dalayed it in complrting its tasks.
* The summer noon as a child, it was always like this. I never get tired of the garden which is fill with the life of joy.
* Now, in the hot isolate, I still love the summer noon, and am stay away from sleeping at noon. Beacuse I care a large green paddy field out the door. The wind blows slowly from the sea, blows through trees' leaves in the courtyard, make the sound of tide. Only at noon on the hotter summer, there will be the sound with cool.
* I sit laying chair in front of the house.
* In the summer sun,The flowers are awake, the trees and the grass are awake, the wind is awake, I am awake.
* I am stay away from sleeping at the noon, beacuse I love the world.
* I can't bear to let life pass in vain in sleep.
* I hope that life is fulfilled and continues in silence.
